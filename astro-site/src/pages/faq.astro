      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">What actually is Clarity.?</h3>
      <p>
        Clarity. is a monthly Support Plan that gives you access to strategic
        insight on demand.<br />
        We provide experts with years of experience who've navigated
        diverse challenges across multiple industries.<br />
        We help you prioritise, align, and make better decisions, without spinning
        up a project or hiring full-time.<br />
        You get all the experience & expertise of premium consultancies for less
        than the day rate of a low level contractor.
        <br /><br />
        You're not buying hours. You're getting Clarity.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        How is this different from hiring a contractor or consultancy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Contractors sell time. Consultants sell scope. <br />Clarity. sells
        clarity.<br />
        Delivered continuous support, embedded in your world, and designed to compound
        value over time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        Do I need to speak to someone to get started?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Nope. You can sign up online, pick your Support Plan, and start right
        away.<br />
        We're built for speed, not friction.<br /><br />
        You can reach out to us directly or via email should you wish to.

        What do I get with a Support Plan?
      </h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
        <li>Structured <strong>Clarity. Sessions</strong></li>
        <li>Clear, decision-ready <strong>Briefs</strong></li>
        <li>Strategic <strong>Radar</strong> on what's coming</li>
        <li><strong>Async input</strong> when you need it</li>
        <li>A named lead (plus backup) who knows your context</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">Wrapped up in our technology and delivery experts.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Our plans differ by how embedded we are, not how many sessions you get.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        Which Support Plan should I choose?
      </h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Base</strong> → You're starting small, want traction fast, or need
          to validate a decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plus</strong> → You're managing multiple priorities and need ongoing
          alignment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Partner</strong> → You need a strategic guide embedded across a
          fast-moving product or organisation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">
        If you're not sure, start light. Most clients scale up once they see how
        it works.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">Can I just try it for a month?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes! But we recommend committing to at least a quarter.<br />
        Clarity. builds momentum through continuous support. A single month gives
        you value. Three gives you compounding impact.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        Will I always work with the same person?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, and more.<br />
        You'll have a named lead, a secondary backup, and a shared context model.<br
        />
        No single point of failure. No context lost.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        What's the cost? Why isn't pricing listed yet?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We'll be publishing pricing at launch. When we do, it'll be open, fixed,
        and fair.<br />
        Right now, early adopters get first access and flexibility.
        <br /><br />
        No hidden fees. No nasty surprises.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        Can I use this across multiple teams?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely.<br />
        Clarity. Plus and Partner are designed for multi-team, multi-stream environments.<br
        />
        The more complexity you manage, the more we help you simplify and steer.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        What if I need to change or cancel my plan?
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can upgrade or adjust at any renewal point. Monthly, quarterly, or
        yearly.<br />
        We're here to grow with you, not trap you.
