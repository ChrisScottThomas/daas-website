  >What actually is Clarity.?</summary>
      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Clarity. is an ongoing Support Plan. You get expert insight, timely
        input, and confident momentum, without spinning up a project or hiring
        someone full-time.
        <br /><br />
        Sometimes it looks like structured discovery. Sometimes it's a strategic
        sounding board. Always: it helps you move forward, faster.
        <br /><br />
        Clarity. sells certainty, not sessions or slide decks. We help you cut through
        the noise and act with confidence.

  >Do I need to speak to someone to get started?</summary>
      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        No. You can join the waitlist and choose a Support Plan online. If you
        want to talk first, that's fine too.
        <br /><br />
        The process is simple. We've designed it to move quickly without adding extra
        steps.

        Yes, that's what the Base plan is designed for. You can start small,
        solve one strategic problem, and upgrade later if it's the right fit.

        Not really. If you have documents, drafts, or slides, feel free to

        <br /><br />
        Every plan includes Discovery-as-a-Service (DaaS). On Base, it's the focus.
        On Plus and Partner, it's one of the ways we help you move forward with confidence.

        Strategy friction, unclear priorities, competing stakeholder views, new

      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Base is focused Discovery-as-a-Service. One question, one team, one
        clear path forward.
        <br /><br />
        Plus gives you joined-up strategic input across multiple teams. Partner embeds
        at the leadership level to bring structure, pace, and long-term certainty.
        <br /><br />
        Plus and Partner include everything in Base, and then some.

        No. Clarity. isn't measured in “session quotas.” We're here when you

        Clarity. gives you senior strategic input without the full-time hire,
        big-deck consultancy, or long procurement cycle.
        <br /><br />
        You pay only for support that moves the needle. We're not the cheapest,
        but we're built to deliver value, fast.
