      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Clarity. is an ongoing Support Plan. You get expert insight, timely
        input, and confident momentum, without spinning up a project or hiring
        someone full-time.
        <br /><br />
        Sometimes it looks like structured discovery. Sometimes it's a strategic
        sounding board. Always: it helps you move forward, faster.
        <br /><br />
        Clarity. sells certainty, not sessions or slide decks. We help you cut through
        the noise and act with confidence.

      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        No. You can join the waitlist and choose a Support Plan online. No calls
        or sales chat required.
        <br /><br />
        Prefer to talk first? You can. Either way, we make it simple to get started
        fast.

        Every plan includes Discovery-as-a-Service (DaaS). On Base, it's the focus.

      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        No. Clarity. doesn't offer delivery teams. No developers, no product
        owners, no managed services. We only do strategic support.
        <br /><br />
        That means we have no reason to steer you toward work you don't need. Our
        only goal is to help you get clear and act with confidence, not to sell the
        next thing.

      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Base is focused Discovery-as-a-Service. One question, one team, one
        clear path forward.
        <br /><br />
        Plus gives you joined-up strategic input across multiple teams. Partner embeds
        at the leadership level to bring structure, pace, and long-term certainty.
        <br /><br />
        Plus and Partner include everything in Base and then some.

      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">

      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Yes. If you have a single strategic question or an urgent problem to
        unpack, Base is perfect. Many clients start there and grow from it.

        No. Clarity. isn't built on session quotas. You're not buying hours,
        you're buying outcomes.
        <br /><br />
        Sessions are one tool. We'll use whatever mix gets you the clarity you need.

        Clarity. gives you senior-level strategic input, without the cost,
        delay, or complexity of hiring, briefing, or onboarding a full team.
        <br /><br />
        You're not paying for time. You're paying to get unstuck, make better decisions,
        and move with confidence.
