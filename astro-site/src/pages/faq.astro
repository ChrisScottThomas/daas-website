      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Clarity. is an ongoing Support Plan. You get expert input, clear
        thinking, and confident momentum. It works without spinning up a project
        or hiring someone full-time.

        <br /><br />
        You'll have strategic backup, ready when you need it.

        >How is this different from hiring a contractor or consultant?</summary
      >
      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Contractors give you time. Consultants give you scope.

        <br /><br />
        Clarity. gives you trusted thinking, without needing a statement of work.
        We stay close to what matters. You get advice that fits the moment, not a
        process that slows you down.

      >
      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        No. You can join the waitlist and choose a Support Plan online. If you
        want to talk first, that's fine too.

        <br /><br />
        The process is simple. We've designed it to move quickly without adding extra
        steps.

      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        You'll have a named lead, async input, Clarity. Sessions, summaries you
        can share, and optional tools.

        <br /><br />
        These are not deliverables for the sake of it. They help you act with confidence
        and reduce the weight of decisions.
