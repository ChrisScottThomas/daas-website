      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Clarity. is an ongoing Support Plan. You get expert insight, timely
        input, and confident momentum — without spinning up a project or hiring
        someone full-time.

        <br /><br />
        Sometimes it looks like structured discovery. Sometimes it's a strategic
        sounding board. Always: it helps you move forward, faster.

      >
      <div class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Contractors give you time. Consultants give you scope.

        <br /><br />
        Clarity. gives you certainty. We work without statements of work or slow
        procurement. You get judgement and insight that fits the moment — not a fixed
        process.

        No. You can join the waitlist and choose a Support Plan online. If you
        want to talk first, that's fine too.

        <br /><br />
        The process is simple. We've designed it to move quickly without adding extra
        steps.

        You'll get expert input, async insight, optional playbacks, and focused
        briefs. Each plan includes what's needed — no filler, no fluff.

        <br /><br />
        We don't just deliver sessions or artefacts. We help you move from problem
        to clarity with confidence.
