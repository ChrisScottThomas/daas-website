    <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">1. About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Clarity. is a trading name of <strong
        >Clarity. Support Services Ltd</strong
      >, a UK-based company registered in England and Wales. Registered office:
      [Insert address].

    <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">2. Our Services</h2>
    <p>
      We provide insight and advisory support services via flexible Support
      Plans for product, delivery, and transformation leaders. These plans grant
      access to ongoing strategic support — not fixed deliverables.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600" />

    <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">3. Human-Led Support</h2>
    <p>
      Our Support Plans are delivered by real people — not bots, scripts, or
      offshore ticket queues. We work flexible but reasonable hours aligned to
      client needs, and we may occasionally be unavailable due to illness,
      holiday, or other human realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we strive to maintain consistent rhythm and responsiveness, this is
      a human-led service — not a 24/7 offering. We'll always give you a
      heads-up where possible and plan around known time away.
    </p>
