        We want you to feel confident and supported when you work with Clarity.
        That means being fair, clear, and human about refunds. If something’s
        gone wrong, we’ll make it right — just get in touch.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">1. No Automatic Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Clarity. Support Plans are prepaid. We do not automatically issue refunds
      for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change of mind</li>
      <li>Unused sessions or time</li>
      <li>Late or forgotten cancellations</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600" />

    <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">2. Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
    <p>
      We understand life happens. If something serious occurs (like illness,
      bereavement, or technical failure), you can request a refund. Each case is
      assessed fairly and individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also request to pause your plan or receive future credit instead
      of a refund if preferred.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">3. Service Guarantee</h2>
    <p>
      If you feel we didn’t deliver what was promised, please tell us within 14
      days of the issue arising. We’ll always aim to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand what went wrong</li>
      <li>
        Make it right — this could mean extra support, a replacement session, or
        a goodwill refund
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div
      class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 mt-6"
    >
      <strong>Note:</strong> If we’ve already significantly delivered your plan or
      service window has passed, we may offer credit rather than a cash refund.
