        Our goal isn't just to meet expectations — it's to surprise and delight
        you. If you're here reading about refunds, it means something hasn't
        felt quite right. Let's fix that, together.

    <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">We Put People First</h2>
    <p>
      Every Clarity. client is a human being, not a transaction. That means we
      approach refund requests with empathy, not red tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether something unexpected came up or you just didn't feel the value,
      we're here to listen and make it right — not argue policy.
    </p>

      The best kind of refund policy is the one no one ever needs — because the
      experience was so thoughtful, so valuable, and so right that you'd never
      dream of leaving. That's what we aim for. Every day.
